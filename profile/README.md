Welcome to the open source community `devlive`! We are a community focused on open source projects, where you can discover the latest and greatest open source projects and participate in them to jointly promote the prosperity and development of the open source ecosystem.

## What is open source?

In computing, open source means that both code and models used in software or hardware design can be viewed, used, modified, and distributed publicly without the need to pay license fees. The essence of open source is sharing and collaboration, with the purpose of creating better and more valuable products and technologies.

## `devlive` mission

As an open source community, our mission is to spread the spirit of open source to every corner of the society, build an open, equal, collaborative, and selfless platform, gather global open source enthusiasts, and jointly promote the development and application of open source.

## our perspective

- **Openness**: We encourage and support openness in all forms. We believe true openness occurs in communication and collaboration in a way that fosters learning, discovery and innovation.
- **Equality**: We believe that everyone should have equal opportunities and rights. We treat every member with respect, regardless of their background, identity or skill level.
- **Collaborative**: We believe that collaboration is the best way to innovate. Collaboration allows us to combine skills, experience and knowledge to create truly useful projects with shared resources.
- **Selfless Dedication**: We believe that the open source community can only grow and thrive on the basis of selfless dedication. We encourage community members to contribute their time, knowledge and resources to the development of the community.
